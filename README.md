This project is an application skeleton for a typical AngularJS web app. You can use it to 
quickly bootstrap Angular projects.

Based off of [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).

Runs a watcher that:
- Runs Karma unit tests
- Compiles Compass
- Loads templates into `$templatCache`
